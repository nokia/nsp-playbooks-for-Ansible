## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nokia/nsp-playbooks-for-Ansible.git
cd nsp-playbooks-for-Ansible

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv ansible-env
source ansible-env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
make install-dev
```

### Understanding Make Targets

The collection uses a Makefile for all development tasks. To see all available targets:

```bash
make help
```

This shows options for:
- Code quality (lint, format)
- Security checks (bandit, audit)
- Validation and testing
- Documentation building
- And more...

## Before You Submit a Pull Request

### Test Your Changes Locally

!!! danger "This is critical!"
    Always test before submitting!

```bash
# Run all quality checks: validate, lint, security
make ci

# Run tests
make test

# Build and preview documentation (if docs changed)
make docs
make docs-serve
```

### Branching and Commits

Use descriptive branch names:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-new-feature   # Feature work
git checkout -b fix/resolve-issue         # Bug fix
git checkout -b docs/improve-guide        # Documentation
git checkout -b test/add-integration      # Test coverage
```

Write clear commit messages:

```
format: <type>: <description>

Examples:
- "feature: add new RPC module for XYZ operations"
- "fix: resolve token expiration timeout issue"
- "docs: add examples to security guide"
```

### If Something Doesn't Feel Right

!!! danger "Don't push it!"
    If you're unsure about anything...

- Mark your PR as **Work In Progress (WIP)** 
- Add `[WIP]` to the PR title
- Request feedback from maintainers
- Explain what you're uncertain about

This helps reviewers understand your status and provide early feedback.
